# Neural Architecture Search: An Implementation using Evolutionary Algorithm
> This implementation is based upon the paper by [Real et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01548) 2018 titled *Regularizedevolution  for  Image  Classifier  Architecture  Search.  Proceedings  of  theAAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence* 

In this implementation we have used evolutionary search to devise a Neural Architecture Search that searches through a randomly generated search space of model genomes and return a genome which gives atleast 75% accuracy on the given dataset (Fashion-MNIST)
